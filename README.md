# Goals
Create a single app for all your journal entries and memory recording. Group your entries by activity, location, or people to relive your memories. Scrappbook is different in creating a dynamic, customizable, and reflective user experience and interaction with multimedia journal entries. 

# Stack
Scrappbook is a desktop application built using Electron and Electron Forge.
It is a local application so that the user data remains personal and protected as a deeply personal, reflective experience. 

# Sources
The application was started using the Electron quickstart.
