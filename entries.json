It was a fun trip and a lot cheaper since Jesse has a Prius. The waves started off great, then the wind went onshore as we changed, but after around 45 min it went turned to a whipping offshore wind. The waves were great for an hr and I got some cover on one. Then we went to Rye Rocks where it looked small, but was pretty solid shoulded/head high. Caught a couple here, but it was fun.","date":"2019-04-05T15:13:00.000Z"},{"people":["Anna"],"places":["Foco","Thayer"],"journals":["sad","major"],"tags":["stress","fun"],"title":"","content":"Today I had no class, but I did hold office hours for ENGS 20 and go to Council.
